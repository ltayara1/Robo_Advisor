# Robo Advisor

## Background
This project was created to attract younger investors. I created a robo advisor that could be used by customers or potential new customers to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement. I combine my Amazon Web Services skills with Python to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

### Initial Robo Advisor Configuration: 
I defined an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that established a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement. 

### Build and test the Robo Advisor: 
I made sure that my bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user, by building and testing it.


### Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function: 
I created an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This task includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.

To see how this works, see the Trial Video in this Github folder.
